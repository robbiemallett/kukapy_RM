# KuKaPy

This repository is for development of the KuKaPy script used in [Nandan et al. (2023; The Cryosphere)](https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-2211-2023).

That code is permanently archived [here](https://zenodo.org/record/7967058).

KuKaPy was originally translated by Vishnu Nandan from a codebase given to us by Jim Mead at Prosensing Inc., and was further developed by Rosemary Willatt and Tom Newman from UCL. 

I've made some small changes to keep it compatable with module updates, and am now working to make it faster, cleaner, and easier to use.
